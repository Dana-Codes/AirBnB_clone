# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description
This project aims to create a simplified clone of the AirBnB website. The implementation will cover fundamental concepts of the higher-level programming track, including a command interpreter, a website with static and dynamic elements, a database or file storage for data persistence, and an API for communication between the front-end and data.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a tool to manipulate data without a visual interface, similar to a shell. It serves as a development and debugging tool, allowing users to interact with the underlying storage system.

### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the following command:
```bash
./console.py
